### Welcome!
To play Minesweeper, run the following command:
`python -m src.main`

### Dependencies:
- Python 3
- curses (Linux) / windows-curses (Windows)
- Standard libraries: enum, platform, random

### Terminal
You must use a terminal that supports curses mouse functionality.
This has been verified using tmux, windows terminal, and Alacritty, but may depend on 
the operating system in use and if all software has been updated. Windows 10 may not work.
The best options are WSL, Linux, or Windows 11.
